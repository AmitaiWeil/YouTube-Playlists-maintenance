# YouTube-Playlists-maintenance (C#)
- Saving to an excel file all titles of all playlists of a YouTube channel, each playlist per worksheet.
- Comparing between saved file and it's last version, so to know which
  videos were deleted in all playlists (if title exists in last version),
  and saving in a worksheet, so that the user can manually delete/look for a substitutes
  for each title.
  
 issues:
  - for a big amount of playlists an error occurres while processing.
  - An option for searching and/or deleting missing videos automatically.
