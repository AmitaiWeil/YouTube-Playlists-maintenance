# YouTube-Playlists-maintenance (C#)
Comparing between titles of videos from all playlists of a YouTube user to a saved copy of the last same search,
so to find the titles of videos which were deleted (in case title exists in last version).
The details of the missing video-titles are saved to a worksheet and all playlists video titles are saved, each playlist per worksheet, so that the user can manually delete/look for a substitute.

Using the software every once in a while can help easily removing/replacing deleted videos which 
YouTube doesnâ€™t provide details about.
